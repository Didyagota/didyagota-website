Didyagota started out as an IRL game visiting territories in Melbourne's Hoddle Street grid.  It was inspired by early seasons of [Jet Lag: The Game](https://nebula.tv/jetlag).

After filming two IRL games, we decided to make an at home board game.  Play testing showed we could create a version using just cards.  

The name came from a common refrain whenever someone visited a known destination: "Did ya go ta x landmark?".
